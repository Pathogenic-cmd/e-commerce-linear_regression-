# 🧠 E-Commerce Spending Prediction Dashboard (Power BI + Python)

This project analyzes customer behavior to predict **Yearly Amount Spent (Revenue)** using a **Linear Regression model**, with data visualized interactively in **Power BI**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates yearly revenue generated by the business using customer usage data. 
**Based on**:
- App and website usage
- Membership duration
- Average session length

The predictions are visualized using an insightful Power BI dashboard to support data-driven marketing and product decisions.

---

## 🔍 Data Overview

The dataset contains the following key features:
- `Avg. Session Length` – average customer session in minutes
- `Time on App` – daily time spent on the mobile app
- `Time on Website` – daily time spent on the website
- `Length of Membership` – how long the customer has been with the company
- `Yearly Revenue` – actual spend (target)
- `Revenue Price Predictions` – predicted spend from the linear model
- `Phase` – whether the data is "Existing" or "New Unseen data"

---

## 🧪 Modeling Approach

Two regression models were trained:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **XGBoost Regressor**

After evaluation, **Linear Regression** performed better:
- ✔️ Lower **RMSE** and **MAE**
- ✔️ Higher **R² Score**
- ✔️ Easier interpretability

> **Final predictions were generated using the Linear Regression model.**

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Time on App** has a **strong positive correlation** with yearly revenue.
- **Time on Website** shows **little to no direct correlation**.
- Longer **membership duration** is also positively associated with spend.
- Customers with higher prediction errors can be analyzed for behavior outliers or targeting opportunities.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

- **KPIs**: Average session length, revenue, app usage
- **Slicers**: Filter by phase (New vs Existing)
- **Scatter Plot**: App usage vs. yearly spend
- **Bar Chart**: Prediction error per customer
- **Interactive Table**: Full customer data with prediction comparison
